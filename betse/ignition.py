#FIXME: Print memory-related metadata when running "betse info" *AND* log
#non-fatal warnings when BETSE is run under a low-memory environment (e.g.,
#< 4GB available free memory). To do so, note the following canonical API:
#
#    psutil.Process(os.getpid()).get_memory_info()

#FIXME: Consider replacing bottleneck Numpy routines with routines imported from
#the following third-party Numpy-like frameworks:
#
#* "bottleneck", providing optimized routines accepting Numpy arrays --
#  implemented in Cython and hence faster than comparible Numpy routines.
#* "numexpr", a Theano-like framework accepting Numpy arrays -- performing
#  CPU-centric parallelization of expensive array operations. Whereas Theano
#  permits such operations to be conveniently expressed in pure-Python, however,
#  numexpr inconveniently requires such operations be expressed as... wait for
#  it, raw strings. So, that sucks. Nonetheless, worth a possible look.
#* "blaze", a purported second-gen Numpy replacement. We harbour sincere doubts,
#  but everything deserves its millisecond to shine in the light. Ah. We see.
#  Blaze is considerably more heavy-weight than Numpy, and largely serves a
#  completely different marketshare: supercomputing. That's well beyond our
#  means, at the moment. Numpy it is!
#
#In short, "bottleneck" is probably the only framework listed above of interest.

#FIXME: Consider optimizing frequently used matrix and vector computations with
#Theano, a general-purpose Python mathematical optimization framework. One
#particularly compelling use case for Theano is to portably distribute
#computational work across multiple GPUs. In general, Theano can be used to
#reduce arbitrarily complex symbolic expressions expressed in pure Python to
#dynamically compiled machine code on-the-fly. Fairly amazing, all around. For
#the high-level synopsis, see:
#
#    http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/introduction.html
#FIXME: Theano and Torch (a similar framewark) appear to now be subsumed by
#TensorFlow, a Google-backed framework originally implemented in support of
#machine learning workflows at Google (e.g., DeepMind), but sufficiently
#generalized as to support a wide variety of computational needs -- like ours.

#FIXME: The "~/.betse" directory grows fairly large fairly quickly. It'd be
#great to emit non-fatal warnings if its size exceeds some reasonable threshold
#(e.g., 1MB).

`True` only if the :func:`init` function has already been called.

That function uses this private boolean to guard against repeated invocations of
that function from multiple modules in the same Python process (e.g.,
:mod:`betse.science.__init__`, :mod:`betse.cli.cliabc`). While that function
does technically support repeated calls, each additional call after the first
inefficiently performs no meaningful work and is thus safely ignorable.
